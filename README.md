# A SQL-database-project
A database for an E-commerce clothing company consisting of all SQL-DDL,DML,DCL and TCL queries, E-R diagram was made and a document containing a final Power BI report of different metrics was used to draw data insights.  
Different entities like order, customer and transaction containing different attributes were linked using primary-foreign key relationship and then tables were Normalized with 3NF leading to removal of redundant and duplicate entries.
